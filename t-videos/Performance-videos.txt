AUTONOMOUS ROBOT TEST – Forward and Reverse Motion

https://youtube.com/shorts/DLdXPhjLxYY

In this test, we were verifying the behavior of the traction system using the LEGO NXT 9842 motor and the DRV8871 driver.
The goal was to confirm that the robot could move forward and backward smoothly under PWM control, maintaining stable direction changes without losing alignment or causing mechanical vibration.

AUTONOMOUS ROBOT TEST – Vision Test: Red and Green Color Detection

During this test, we were calibrating the color detection system of the provisional camera.
We focused on adjusting the HSV and LAB masks in OpenCV to correctly identify red and green pillars, which are essential for obstacle decision-making during the Obstacle Challenge.

TEST – Forward and Backward

In this experiment, we were testing the encoder’s response and traction symmetry by moving the robot back and forth multiple times.
The purpose was to verify that both acceleration and braking were consistent, and that the robot maintained linear stability when changing direction.

OPEN CHALLENGE – Clockwise Run

Here we were performing one of the first complete runs of the Open Challenge in the clockwise direction.
We tested PD steering tuning, lane centering using the front ROI, and overall stability during continuous lap navigation around the playfield.

OPEN CHALLENGE – Counterclockwise Run

This session was focused on validating the same Open Challenge run but in the counterclockwise direction.
We were confirming that the PD control, ROI detection, and camera calibration worked equally well in both orientations, ensuring symmetrical performance and algorithm consistency.
